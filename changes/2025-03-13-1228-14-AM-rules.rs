/// A module for managing spam detection rules and sender scores using a SQLite database
/// and custom Lua-based rule evaluation.
///
/// This module provides a `RuleManager` struct that handles the storage and application
/// of spam detection rules, as well as tracking sender behavior through a database.
/// It uses `rusqlite` for database operations, `std::sync` for thread-safe access,
/// and `rlua` for executing Lua scripts to evaluate custom rules.
/// 
use rlua::Lua;
use rusqlite::{Connection, Result};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

/// Represents a single spam detection rule consisting of a keyword and an associated score.
///
/// The `Rule` struct is used to define patterns (keywords) and their corresponding
/// spam scores, which are evaluated against messages to determine spam likelihood.
/// It is marked as `Clone` to allow easy duplication of rule instances.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Rule {
    /// The keyword or pattern to match against messages (e.g., "spam", "http").
    pub keyword: String,
    /// The score associated with the keyword, indicating its spam weight (e.g., 10.0 for "spam").
    pub score: f32,
}

/// Manages spam detection rules and sender scores using a SQLite database.
///
/// The `RuleManager` struct maintains a thread-safe connection to a SQLite database
/// and an in-memory cache of rules. It provides methods to initialize the database,
/// add rules, update sender scores, retrieve sender scores, and evaluate messages
/// against custom rules defined in a Lua script.

    /// multi-threaded environment, while the `Connection` handles SQL queries.
    pub conn: Mutex<Connection>,
    /// A thread-safe cache of active rules loaded from the database.
    ///
    /// The `Arc<Mutex<Vec<Rule>>>` allows shared ownership and safe mutation of
    /// the rule list across threads.
